This *FPNet* [[Source](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fosnic9d0b1ta1m/AADBhGZbPoIuBovZpF4bEaefa?dl=0)] is able to reconstruct walls in areas with overlapping graphics or nonuniform patterns, thus allowing the room structures to be recovered even from complicated drawings.

Code borrows heavily from [[Isola *et al*](https://github.com/phillipi/pix2pix)]. The floor plan datasets originated from *EAIS-fp* [[Jang *et al*](https://)] and *SNU-fp* [[Kim *et al*](https://)], and in purpose of increasing the varsarity of the datasets, we added more drawings in diverse formats.
